# Dell-R710-BIOS-update

My guide on how to update bios on the Dell PowerEdge R710 server

## Specification

- Dell PowerEdge R710
- 2x Intel Xeon E5520
- 128GB DDR3 ECC RAM
- 146GB HDD SAS
- 600GB HDD SAS
- 900GB HDD SAS
- 2x 870 W PSUs
- 
## Prerequisites

- A USB stick ( minimum 8 Gigs )
- Another device capable of running Rufus software
- 
## Step 1: Preparing the USB

  First you need to get the bios on the USB somehow. Go onto this website <a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus. </a>
Then download the executable file from here ![IMG_6015](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc74a2aa-9485-4b05-866f-4c8212378ab0)</br>
I highly reccomend the version with the "p" at the end. The "p" stands for portable so it does not installation. Next you need to get the iso file for bios.
